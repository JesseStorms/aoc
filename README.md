# advent of gode

my repo for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges in go, because i want to learn go.

it will be a mess. do not expect anything good, since this is my first time using go lol.

## how to run

put your input in a file called `input.txt` in the same directory as the executable.

then run `go run main.go` and it should work.
